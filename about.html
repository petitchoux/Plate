    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="indent">	<span class="italic">Plate</span> takes a series of photos of food and displays it on the web in a way where people can interact with it by swiping on what they like and don’t like. Underneath the photos, the user will be presented with the option to learn more about each plate and the process of making them. This design was inspired by the many dating apps that exist today in which one can easily judge another with one photo and swipe right to get a possible match or left to pass on that person. While it is impossible to get a match with food with this application, the user can read the food’s “bio” and other pictures. </p>
            <p class="indent">The use of this platform was chosen for many reasons including: (1) it shows how easy it is for us to take things at face value, (2) the amount of data we have access to in this world today in which we can choose to tune into or out of, and (3) it is a platform that is relatively well known among the different spreads of ages and therefore has a familiar user interface. </p>
            <p class="indent">Another goal that <span class="italic">Plate</span> aims to do is to educate users on how these desserts were made. Food photography is an art within itself, but it focuses on the final product in which each plate is set up and stylized with props intentionally. What about the process in making the pastries themselves? This procedure often goes undermined. <span class="italic">Plate</span> hopes to teach viewers that there is work in the process of making art.

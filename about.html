    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="indent"> <span class="italic">plattr</span> takes a series of photos of food and displays it on the web in a way where people can interact with it by choosing to like it or pass on it. Accompanied with each dish is their name and "bio" (or a pickup line in
        this case). The use of this design was inspired by the many dating apps that exist today in which one can easily judge another with one photo and swipe right to get a possible match or left to pass on that person. </p>
    <p class="indent">
        While the stylized photo and end product is what users usually see on social media, the process in making them is often overlooked. The goal of <span class="italic">plattr</span> is to show users images of how these dishes were made and what went
        into them.
        <span class="italic">plattr</span> hopes to teach viewers that there is work in the process of making art.

    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <h3>1. How do I use this site? </h3>
    <p class="indent">Start by clicking on "plattr" below to begin a new session (it will reset the matches that the user before you clicked on). From here, you can either press the X or the heart based on whether you like or dislike the dish in front of you. Each dish
        will subsequently have 2-4 photos in which you can browse through. You can choose to view your matches at any time by clicking "Matches" in the navigation bar below or it will automatically redirect you to the Matches page after there are no more
        matches for you to swipe through. If you are interested in learning more about each dish, their recipes are linked in the Credit page.</p>
    <h3>2. Why Tinder? </h3>
    <p class="indent">The use of this platform was chosen for many reasons including: (1) it shows how easy it is for us to take things at face value, (2) the amount of data we have access to in this world today in which we can choose to tune into or out of, and (3) it
        is a platform that is relatively well known among the different spreads of ages and therefore has a familiar user interface. </p>
    <p class="indent">In other words, Tinder is a widespread application that connects millions of users together. It is also infamously shallow as users choose to either swipe left or right on someone based on their appearance. This project aims to show the pretty, stylized
        photo of the end product, but also the process and ingredients that go into making them. </p>

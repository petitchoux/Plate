**Brief description:**  
	plattr is an interactive web application that invites people to click through a series of photos of food and decide on whether they like it or want to take a pass. At the end, all foods that they liked will be displayed in a list on the Matches page.

**Project Description :**  
	Plattr takes a series of photos of food and displays it on the web in a way where people can interact with it by swiping on what they like and don’t like. Underneath the photos, the user will be able to see the name and their bio. This design was inspired by the many dating apps that exist today in which one can easily judge another with one photo and swipe right to get a possible match or left to pass on that person. While it is impossible to get a match with food, the user can go through the photos in order to learn more about the process and ingredients that go into making them.   
	The use of this platform was chosen for many reasons including: (1) it shows how easy it is for us to take things at face value, (2) the amount of data we have access to in this world today in which we can choose to tune into or out of, and (3) it is a platform that is relatively well known among the different spreads of ages and therefore has a familiar user interface.    
  
**Artist Statement:**  
	It all starts with the plate. From a stroke of a brush (or many), the iconic squeeze bottle dots, to the abstract splatters and dusting of gold or the like, the plate is your blank canvas and it is up to you to decide how the finished product will be displayed. In a series of photos, I will be displaying finished products of plated food as well as their work in progress. We often consume this form of temporary art, but don’t always consider how it’s done. I want to give transparency to the viewer of how each plate was designed and executed.   
As a former cook at fine dining restaurants, I realized that the back-of-the-house doesn’t often get as much recognition or credit compared to other jobs in general. Not many people realize that culinary arts is a whole field in itself. We go through an education, take classes on business management, food costing, food styling, etc., and tuition is as much as $17,710 per semester.   
I got into food because it made me happy to be able to create something that made others happy. I’ve also always loved the arts in all of its shapes and forms and to me, food plating is a form of art where the plate itself, which can take many forms, is the canvas. Thus, this project is something I want to give to everyone to let them know how easy it is to be able to recreate these dishes at home.   
I originally planned the photos to be displayed as a slideshow in no particular order, but have decided to build a website and use that as my platform instead. Having a website enables this piece to be interactive. The design is inspired by the dating app Tinder. As a millennial and CIS major, I cannot avoid the use of technology and the rising presence of social media. Apps like Tinder feel so superficial and makes me realize how technology has enabled us to easily consume visual content on the go at a swipe of a finger. Thus, the photos will be displayed in a manner where users can interactively click through each plate and see their work in progress photos and “bios” if they wish to. Otherwise, they can move on to the next plate if they “swipe left.”  

**Technical Rider:** This piece will require a monitor connected to a computer that can display the website (html files) and a trackpad that will serve as the mouse for the user to move from image to image. THe computer must be connected to the internet in order to use the Fotorama library.
